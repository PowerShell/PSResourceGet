Get PowerShellGet Module
========================

Please refer to our [documentation](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerShellGet/) for the up-to-date version on how to get the PowerShellGet Module.

Get PowerShellGet Source
========================

#### Steps

* Obtain the source
    - Download the latest source code from the release page (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/releases) OR
    - Clone the repository (needs git)
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet
    ```

* Navigate to the local repository directory

```powershell
PS C:\> cd c:\Repos\PowerShellGet
PS C:\Repos\PowerShellGet>
```

* Install PSPackageProject module if needed

```powershell
if ((Get-Module -Name PSPackageProject -ListAvailable).Count -eq 0) {
    Install-Module -Name PSPackageProject -Repository PSGallery
}
```

* Build the project

```powershell
# Build for the netstandard2.0 framework
PS C:\Repos\PowerShellGet> .\build.ps1 -Clean -Build -BuildConfiguration Debug -BuildFramework netstandard2.0

# Build for the net472 framework
PS C:\Repos\PowerShellGet> .\build.ps1 -Build -BuildConfiguration Debug -BuildFramework net472
```

* Publish the module to a local repository

```powershell
PS C:\Repos\PowerShellGet> .\build.ps1 -Publish
```

* Run functional tests

```powershell
PS C:\Repos\PowerShellGet> Invoke-PSPackageProjectTest -Type Functional
```

* Import the module into a new PowerShell session

```powershell
# If running PowerShell 6+
C:\> Import-Module C:\Repos\PowerShellGet\out\PowerShellGet

# If running Windows PowerShell
C:\> Import-Module C:\Repos\PowerShellGet\out\PowerShellGet\PowerShellGet.psd1
```

**Note**  
PowerShellGet consists of .NET binaries and so can be imported into a PowerShell session only once.
Since the PSPackageProject module, used to build the module, has a dependency on earlier versions of PowerShellGet, the newly built module cannot be imported into that session.
The new module can only be imported into a new session that has no prior imported PowerShellGet module.
